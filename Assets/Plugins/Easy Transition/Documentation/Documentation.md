### **1. Introduction**

Thank you for choosing Easy Transition! This asset is a powerful and flexible system for creating professional, animated scene transitions in your Unity project, built on a robust ScriptableObject architecture.

**Key Features:**
*   **Asynchronous Loading:** Prevents game freezes and stutters between scenes.
*   **ScriptableObject Based:** Create and configure endless transition variations without writing new code.
*   **Easily Extensible:** Create your own custom effects by inheriting from the `TransitionEffect` class.
*   **Full C# Source Code Included**
*   **6 Effect Types Included:** Fade, Wipe, Circle, Cellular, Noise, and Pixelate.

### **2. Quick Start Guide**

1.  **Add the Manager:**
    Drag the `SceneTransitioner` prefab from `Easy Transition/Prefabs/` into your *first* scene (e.g., your Main Menu).

2.  **Create an Effect:**
    In your Project window, right-click and go to `Create -> Easy Transition` to create a new `Fade Effect`, `Wipe Effect`, etc. Select this new asset and configure its settings in the Inspector.

3.  **Call from Script:**
    From any script, call the transition using the effect you just created:
    ```csharp
    SceneTransitioner.Instance.LoadScene("YourSceneName", yourTransitionEffect);
    ```

**Done!** See the Demo Scene in `Assets/Easy Transition/Demo/Scenes/` for live examples.

### **3. The ScriptableObject Workflow**

The core of this asset is the `TransitionEffect` ScriptableObject. Instead of having one complex manager, you create small, reusable "Effect" assets in your project. This allows you to create many different transition styles and variations easily without coding.

For example, you can create a "FastWipe.asset" and a "SlowWipe.asset" from the same `WipeEffect` script, just with different duration values.

---

### **4. Core Components**

*   **`SceneTransitioner` Prefab:** The "brain" of the system. A singleton that persists across scenes and runs the transitions. You only need one in your very first scene.
*   **`TransitionEffect` Scripts:** The ScriptableObject assets that define what a transition looks like (e.g., `FadeEffect`, `CircleEffect`).
*   **`DemoSceneController` Script:** An example script in the demo that shows the correct way to call the `LoadScene()` method.

---

### **5. Configuration**

You can control which transition is used in two ways:

**1. Global Default:**
Set the **"Default Transition"** field on the `SceneTransitioner` prefab. If you call `LoadScene()` without specifying an effect, this one will be used.

**2. Per-Transition Override:**
Pass a specific `TransitionEffect` asset directly into the `LoadScene()` method. This is the recommended approach for most transitions.

---

### **6. Creating Custom Effects**

You can easily create your own effects:
1. Create a new C# script that inherits from `TransitionEffect`.
2. Implement the `AnimateOut` and `AnimateIn` methods.
3. Add a `[CreateAssetMenu]` attribute to your new class.

You can look at `FadeEffect.cs` or `WipeEffect.cs` for a clear example.

### **7. FAQ & Support**

**Q: My transition is not appearing on top of my UI!**  
A: The `SceneTransitioner` automatically creates its own Canvas with a very high "Sort Order" (999). If you are using multiple Canvases with custom Sort Orders, ensure your game's Canvases have a Sort Order lower than 999.
